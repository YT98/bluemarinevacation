#Blue Marine Vacation Website Project

This repo was made for personal use but feel free to browse my code.

Stack :
- Node.js
- Express
- React.js

Features :
- REST API using express for storing and accessing information about the different holdings of Blue Marine Vacation.
- Server-side rendering React.js
- Yet to implement: The Estates page will feature a Google Maps component and a dynamic interface the user can use to browse the different holdings of the company (think airbnb.com).
